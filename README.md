# CGPA Calculator Website

This is a simple and interactive website designed to help students calculate their semester CGPA. Users can input their marks for various subjects, and the website will compute the CGPA using JavaScript functions and display the result in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Calculation**: Results are displayed instantly on the website after input.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily update the logic to handle different grading systems or add more features.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and dynamic updates of CGPA calculations.

## How It Works

1. Users enter their marks for all subjects in the input fields provided.
2. The website processes the marks using JavaScript functions.
3. The calculated CGPA is displayed directly on the page.
